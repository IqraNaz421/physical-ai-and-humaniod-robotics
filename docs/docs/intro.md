# 🤖 Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**This platform is the definitive guide for your deep dive into intelligent, physical robotic systems.**

This textbook offers a comprehensive, chapter-by-chapter guide covering the essential theoretical foundations and practical applications that merge Artificial Intelligence with advanced robotics.

## Why Study Physical AI?

Unlike purely software-based AI, **Physical AI** focuses on intelligent agents—such as **humanoid robots**—that directly interact with the real world. Our curriculum aims to provide a fundamental understanding of how these complex systems perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute physical actions in unstructured settings.

### Course Structure Highlights:

* **Chapter 1: Foundations:** Core concepts in Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control Theory.
* **Chapter 2: Perception:** Advanced sensor fusion, computer vision, and LiDAR processing.
* **Chapter 3: Intelligence & Action:** Planning algorithms, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and ethical considerations in robotics.
* **Chapter 4: Humanoid Platforms:** In-depth look at existing humanoid architectures and their programming.
